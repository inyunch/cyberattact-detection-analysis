### C. Data Processing Steps

1. Load raw datasets
2. Remove duplicates (53 rows from Global Threats)
3. Check for missing values (none found)
4. Validate data types
5. Check value ranges and integrity
6. Create derived features for analysis
7. Standardize features for PCA
8. Perform statistical tests
9. Generate visualizations

### D. Reproducibility

All analysis code is available in the repository:
- `modules/data_analysis.py`: Main analysis functions
- `app.py`: Streamlit application
- `data/`: Raw datasets (not tracked in git)

To reproduce:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
